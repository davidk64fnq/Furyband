#####R=== Assassins ===
#####GDescription
Assassin are similar to Rogues, but have trained their combat abilities more
extensively by neglecting the study of magic. They also tend to be more stealthy
and careful in their dungeon exploration, but aren't so good at stealing,
trapping and disarming as their more "peaceful" counterparts.

Assassins have access to the schools of *****m_movement.txt*0[Movement], *****m_knowledge.txt*0[Knowledge] and *****m_tempo.txt*0[Temporal] magic.
