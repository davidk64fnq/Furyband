#####R=== Golems ===

#####GDescription
Golems are creatures made from clay and brought to life in a strong 
fire by a powerful sorceror.  They are very strong, but very stupid 
and slow.  Normal food gives golems very little nutrition, however 
they are able to feed themselves with a innate power that they possess.
